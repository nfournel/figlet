If you like FIGlet (hey, even if you *hate* FIGlet), please send an
e-mail message to <figlet@uiuc.edu>.

We run an e-mail list dedicated to FIGlet software and font
announcements, as well as general discussion about FIGlet.  If you
would like to be on this list, send e-mail to listserv@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu
with the message body
        subscribe figlet-l YOUR NAME
where YOUR NAME should be replaced with your name.  For those who don't
want to be bothered with the discussions, the list can be configured so
that you only see software update notices, or only software and font
announcements.
